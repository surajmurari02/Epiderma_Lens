Overview
Epiderma Lens utilizes a deep learning approach to identify and classify skin diseases from images. The model is built using Keras and TensorFlow, and it is trained on a dataset of labeled skin disease images.

Features
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Architecture: A robust CNN model with multiple layers for accurate predictions.
Data Augmentation: Utilizes image data augmentation to improve model generalization.
Model Checkpointing: Saves the best model during training based on validation accuracy.
Evaluation Metrics: Provides detailed accuracy, loss metrics, and confusion matrix for evaluation.

Installation
